3. Reformulate the question to include all necessary context, making it standalone.
4. Ensure the reformulated question is clear, concise, and can be understood without any additional information.

Provide your response in the following format:
standalone question: [Your reformulated standalone question here]

standalone question: Who wrote "Pride and Prejudice"?

Example 3:
conversation history: The user mentioned they have a golden retriever named Max.
